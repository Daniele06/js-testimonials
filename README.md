JS challenge 7

Exercise 7 from the 100+ Javascript projects page (https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

Similar to the background image slider project, except this time i used a object array for all the different info (Took me a while to figure out how to do it, but i did it).
